        <p>This map shows basic census information regarding the population
            of New Zealad, with emphasis on Maori statistics. Unlike most
            New Zealand census maps, this interactive graphic
            shows census infomation on the Territorial Authority District
            level as opposed to a regional level.
            Click on a district or bar graph line to make the population pyramid 
            specific to that district. Blue is the amount of men, red the amount 
            of women, and purple is where they overlap.
            Click on the black map to set it to all of New Zealand again.
            Select different attributes to be vizualized on the choropleth map
            and bar graph by using the drop-down menu. Hover over anything to 
            get more information.</p>
